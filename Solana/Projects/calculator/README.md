# Solana Smart Contract Calculator

This project is a simple calculator implemented as a Solana smart contract using the Anchor framework. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and mathematical functions directly on the Solana blockchain. This project was inspired by an exercise in the Rareskills article, ["Arithmetic and Basic Types in Solana and Rust"](https://www.rareskills.io/post/rust-arithmetic-operators).

## Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, returning a result or handling division errors.
- **Square Root**: Calculates the square root of a number, handling non-negative inputs.
- **Logarithm Base 10**: Calculates the base-10 logarithm of a positive number.
