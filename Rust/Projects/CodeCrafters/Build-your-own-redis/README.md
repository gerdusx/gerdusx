# Build Your Own Redis in Rust

Welcome to my journey through Codecrafters' "Build Your Own Redis" challenge! Redis is an in-memory data structure store commonly used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. Through this project, I’m recreating Redis’ functionality from the ground up using Rust, while exploring TCP servers, the Redis Protocol, RDB files, and much more.

This is a *build in public* project, and I’m posting updates after each stage, sharing insights, challenges, and key takeaways.

## Project Stages

Codecrafters designed this challenge with **55 stages** to guide you through building a fully functional Redis server. Currently, I'm at **Stage 3** and progressing stage by stage.

Each stage is a learning step toward understanding Redis internals, from handling basic commands to RDB file parsing.
